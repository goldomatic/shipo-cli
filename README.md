## FAQ

### What happens if I hit my daily post limit?
shipo-CLI will gently (or not-so-gently) tell you to take a break and try again tomorrow. Or just set a higher limit. Youâ€™re the boss.

### Can I add hashtags automatically?
You bet! `#shipo-CLI` is added to every post because branding is important.

### Does shipo-CLI work on Windows?
Yes, but youâ€™ll need to build the binary for Windows:
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o shipo-cli.exe
```
